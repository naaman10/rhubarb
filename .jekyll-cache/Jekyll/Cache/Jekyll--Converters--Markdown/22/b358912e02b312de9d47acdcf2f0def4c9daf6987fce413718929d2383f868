  <li>w like to be fed twice a day, first at 8am and again at 7pm</li>
  <li>I have half a pack of my raw food straight from the fridge to my bowl. When itâ€™s time to give me food, make sure I go to my place first and then only give me my food when you say okay</li>
  <li>Please can I have a fresh bowl of water with each meal too? Good to stay hydrated</li>
