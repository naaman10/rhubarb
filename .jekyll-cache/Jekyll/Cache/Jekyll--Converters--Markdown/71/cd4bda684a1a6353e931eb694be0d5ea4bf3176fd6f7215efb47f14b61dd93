  <li>I really love a good walk, but while im on rest I can only do two 10 minute walks a day on lead</li>
  <li>My people will leave you my lead, collar, harness and treat bag</li>
  <li>I love to go to the park for a walk</li>
  <li>Because I’ll be in a new area, I’d like to stay on lead so I don’t get lost</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>tip</strong></p>

<p>I get excited when I see other people and doggies on walks and I love to say hello. Telling me to heel with a tasty treat will help keep me from pulling</p>
