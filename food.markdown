  * I like to be fed twice a day, first at 8am and again at 7pm
  * I have 350g of my raw food straight from the fridge to my bowl. The scales are next to the microwave

    **tip**

    Take food to feed me from the left hand side of the tray and replenish from the freezer to the right hand side of the tray
