  <li>we like to be fed twice a day, first at 8am and again at 7pm</li>
  <li>rhu has 200g of her raw food straight from the fridge to my bowl. honey has 390g of her raw food too (greedy). when itâ€™s time to give us food, make sure we go to our place first and then only give us my food when you say okay</li>
  <li>Please can I have a fresh bowl of water with each meal too? Good to stay hydrated</li>
</ul>
