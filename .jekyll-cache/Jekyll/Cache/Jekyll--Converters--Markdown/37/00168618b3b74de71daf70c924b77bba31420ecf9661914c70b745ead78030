  <li>we like to be fed twice a day, first at 8am and again at 7pm</li>
  <li>rhu has 200g of her raw food straight from the fridge to my bowl. honey has 390g of her raw food too (greedy). when it‚Äôs time to give us food, make sure I go to my place first and then only give me my food when you say okay</li>
  <li>Please can I have a fresh bowl of water with each meal too? Good to stay hydrated</li>
</ul>
