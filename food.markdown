  * we like to be fed twice a day, first at 8am and again at 7pm

  * rhu has 200g of her raw food straight from the fridge to my bowl. honey has 390g of her raw food too (greedy). when it's
  time to give us food, make sure we go to our place first and then only give us
  our food when you say 'okay rhubarb' and 'okay honey'

  * Please can we have a fresh bowl of water with each meal too? Good to stay
  hydrated
