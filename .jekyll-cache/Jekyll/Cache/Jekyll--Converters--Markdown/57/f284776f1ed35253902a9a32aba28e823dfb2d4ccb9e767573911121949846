I"M<p>hello, my name is <strong>rhubarb</strong>, I’m a golden retiever and all round good girl  <br /> <br /> thank you for looking after me while my parents are away. <br /> <br /> usually, I’m a super chill pup but staying with you will be new and exciting. <br /> here’s something you should know, I have got a little injury so I need your help… <br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>I am on rest duty so can only go on two 10 minute walks a day on lead</li>
  <li>please don’t let me go up any stairs</li>
  <li>I’m also not allowed to play very much but I can still have cuddles</li>
</ul>
