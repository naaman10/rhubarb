  * I really love a good walk, I like to go out for a walk once a day for about
  an hour or so

  * My people will leave you my lead, collar, harness and treat bag

  * I love to go to the park for a walk

  * Because I'll be in a new area, I'd like to stay on lead so I don't get lost


  **tip**

  hello. Telling me to heel with a tasty treat will help keep me from pulling
