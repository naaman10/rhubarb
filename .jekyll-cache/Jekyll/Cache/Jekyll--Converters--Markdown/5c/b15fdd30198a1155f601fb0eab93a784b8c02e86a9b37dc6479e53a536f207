  <li>I really love a good walk, I like to go out for a walk once a day for about an hour or so</li>
  <li>My people will leave you my lead, collar, harness and treat bag</li>
  <li>I love to go to the park for a walk</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>tip</strong></p>

<p>I get excited when I see other people and doggies on walks and I love to say hello. Telling me to heel with a tasty treat will help keep me from pulling</p>
