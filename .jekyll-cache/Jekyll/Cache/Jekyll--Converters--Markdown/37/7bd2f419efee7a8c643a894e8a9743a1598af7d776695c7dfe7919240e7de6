  <li>I like to be fed twice a day, first at 8am and again at 7pm</li>
  <li>I have 350g of my raw food straight from the fridge to my bowl. The scales are next to the microwave</li>
  <li>When itâ€™s time to sort give me food, make sure I go to my place first and then only give me my food when you say okay</li>
  <li>
    <p>Please can I have a fresh bowl of water with each meal too? Good to stay hydrated</p>

    <p><strong>tip</strong></p>

    <p>Take food to feed me from the left hand side of the tray and replenish from the freezer to the right hand side of the tray</p>
  </li>
