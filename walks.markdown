  have 350g of my raw food straight from the fridge to my bowl. The scales are next
  to the microwave\n* When it's time to sort give me food, make sure I go to my place
  first and then only give me my food when you say okay\n* Please can I have a fresh
  bowl of water with each meal too? Good to stay hydrated \n\n  **tip**\n\n  Take
  food to feed me from the left hand side of the tray and replenish from the freezer
  to the right hand side of the tray"
