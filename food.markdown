  * I like to be fed twice a day, first at 8am and again at 7pm

  * I have 250g of my raw food straight from the fridge to my bowl. When it's
  time to give me food, make sure I go to my place first and then only give me
  my food when you say okay

  * Please can I have a fresh bowl of water with each meal too? Good to stay
  hydrated
