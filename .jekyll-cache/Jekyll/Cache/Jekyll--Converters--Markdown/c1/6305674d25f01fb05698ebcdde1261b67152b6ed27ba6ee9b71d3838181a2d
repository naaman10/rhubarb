  <li>I really love a good walk, I like to go out for a walk once a day for about an hour or so</li>
  <li>
    <p>My lead, collar and harness will be all I need</p>
  </li>
  <li>I love to go to the park for a walk</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>tip</strong></p>

<p>I get excited when I see other people and doggies on walks and I love to say hello. Telling me to heel with a tasty treat will help keep me from pulling</p>
